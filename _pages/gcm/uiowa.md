## Background
* typical education of South Korea 
* unique interests in mathematics
* wider benefits of statistics: 
  > find risk factors for multi-drug resistant diseases that are caused by super bacteria

  > decode seemingly chaotic conversations between politicians into a <span style="color:yellow">political conflict on national health and welfare topics

* after witnessing ... => interested in using statistical models on the <span style="color:yellow">biomedicine data 
* high dimensional variable selection => author an application paper on high dimensional penalized least squares during my master's course

## Future career goal

* ultimate professional goal: scholar developing statistical methodologies
* In the future: 
  > postdoc training in the <span style="color:yellow">public health sector like other UI graduates

  > engage with other scientists in <span style="color:yellow">interdisciplinary studies 
* work as a faculty and <span style="color:yellow">develop methodologies for the most complex human diseases

## Why us?

* BIOS or DS concentration area: the best fit for <span style="color:yellow">developing statistical models to practice applications 
* broaden my academic experience and knowledge <span style="color:yellow">learning various subfields such as causal inference or ML for biomedicine
* would like to work with:
  > Dr. Jian Huang - ‘variable selection in HD’ and <span style="color:yellow">versatile in biomedical applications

  > Dr. Boxiang Wang - ‘sparse tensor regression’
