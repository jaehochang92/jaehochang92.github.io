## Background
* typical education of South Korea 
* unique interests in using mathematics to impact our lives
* thorugh the research on university majors => statistics is a mathematical science that learns our world and nature from the data
* benefits: 
  > ... <span style="color:yellow">a political conflict on national health and welfare topics

  > ... using GLMs and statistical learning
* after witnessing ... => interested in using statistical models on the <span style="color:yellow">biomedicine data 
* high dimensional variable selection => author an application paper on high dimensional penalized least squares during my master's course

  > conn btw LDA - LS\
  > p > n\
  > QM applied PLS on HD LDA with lasso penalty 2 induce sparsity in model selection
  > * lasso\
	> . great prediction accuracy\
	> . fails to attain variable selection consistency under the violation of IC (Zhao & Yu, 2006)
  > * MCL: ncpen, so no IC\
  >	. lasso + MCP\
	> . 2 tp: sparsity + concavity\
	> . found non-asymptotic conditions 4 OL ppt\
	> . demonstrated the good prediction & variable selection perf.

## Future career goal

* ultimate professional goal: scholar developing statistical methodologies
* In the future: 
  > . postdoc training in the <span style="color:yellow">public health sector</span>\
  > . engage with other scientists in <span style="color:yellow">interdisciplinary studies 
* work as a faculty and develop methodologies for <span style="color:yellow">the most complex human diseases like cancer and alzheimer's
* aspirational!
  > I 1 2 study in ... which possesses
  > * abundant research opportunities 4 students
  > * extraordinary academic background
