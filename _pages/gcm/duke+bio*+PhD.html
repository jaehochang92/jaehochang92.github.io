      <td>I got a follow-up acceptance email this evening from the DSCB program (email the other day was the official graduate school saying to check portal status). It mentioned there is a waitlist if I am not going to accept the offer so they can then extend offers to the waitlist. I think this is the first round of acceptances (just based on timeline/waiting for approval from grad school), but if it wasn't I was not notified of my waitlist status before the offer. Hope that helps</td>
