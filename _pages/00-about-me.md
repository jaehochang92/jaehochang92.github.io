I am a prospective Ph.D. student planning to study in the United States. I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Applied Statistics at <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Eng/Index.do" target="_blank">Konkuk University</a> under the supervision of professor <a href="http://home.konkuk.ac.kr/~kyusangu" target="_blank">Kyusang Yu</a>.

## Background

* I grew up taking typical education of South Korea but I have always had unique interests in mathematics, so I decided to study statistics at the university. My time in the university has shown me much wider benefits of statistics. For example, I was able to find risk factors for multi-drug resistant diseases caused by super bacteria. Also, I could decode seemingly chaotic conversations between politicians into a political conflict on national health and welfare topics.

* After witnessing the potential of this type of works, I have been more interested in using statistical models on medical or biological data. Specifically, I found studying high dimensional modeling interesting, leading to authoring an application paper on high dimensional penalized least squares during my master's course.

## Future career goal

* My ultimate professional goal is to be a scholar developing biostatistical methodologies. In the future, I hope to do postdoc training in the public health sector, and then work as a faculty and develop methodologies for most complex human diseases.
