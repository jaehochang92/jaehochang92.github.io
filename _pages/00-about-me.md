I am a prospective Ph.D. student planning to study in the United States. I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Applied Statistics at <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Eng/Index.do" target="_blank">Konkuk University</a> under the supervision of professor <a href="http://home.konkuk.ac.kr/~kyusangu" target="_blank">Kyusang Yu</a>.

## Future career goal

* My ultimate professional goal is to be a scholar developing applied statistical methodologies. In the future, I hope to do postdoc training in the public health sector and engage with other scientists in interdisciplinary studies. Then I desire to work as a faculty and develop methodologies for the most complex human diseases.
