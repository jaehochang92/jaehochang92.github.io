## Background

* unique interests in using math. to impact our lives
* 🔬 on college majors => statistics is a math. science that learns our world and nature from the data
* benefits: 
  > * <span style="color:yellow">a political conflict on national health and welfare topics
  > * using GLMs and statistical learning algorithms(XGboosting, RF)
* after witnessing ... => interested in using statistical models on the <span style="color:yellow">biomedical data 
* HD var. sel. => an appl. paper on HD peanlized LS during my master's course

  > conn btw LDA - LS\
  > When p > n\
  > Mai[^1] applied PLS on HD LDA with lasso penalty 2 induce sparsity in model selection
  > * lasso\
	> . 👍 predct. accy.\
	> . fails to attain var. sel. consistency under the violation of Irrep. Condition (Zhao & Yu, 2006)
  > * MCL: ncpen, so no IC\
  >	. lasso + MCP\
	> . 2 tp: sparsity + concavity\
	> . found non-asympt. conditions 4 OL ppt\
	> . demonstrated the 👍 predct. & var. sel. consistency

## Future career goal

* ultimate profss. goal: scholar developing statistical methodologies
* In the future: 
  > * postdoc training in the <span style="color:yellow">public health sector</span>
  > * engage with other scientists in <span style="color:yellow">interdisciplinary studies 
* faculty: develops methodologies for <span style="color:yellow">the most complex human diseases like cancer, tumor, and alzheimer's

* aspirational! => need help!

## Why us?

* I 1 2 study in \_\_\_\_\_\_ bc. \_\_\_\_\_\_ can provide me a firm academic education and background for my future career.

* rigorous training in theories and math
  
* many courses on biostatistical methodologies:

* \_\_\_\_\_\_ has many great professors who study biostatistics, statistical genetics, and high-dimensional data analysis which are close to my interests.\
