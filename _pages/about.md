I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Applied Statistics at <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Eng/Index.do" target="_blank">Konkuk University</a> under the supervision of professor <a href="http://home.konkuk.ac.kr/~kyusangu" target="_blank">Kyusang Yu</a>.
  
  ```c
  #include<stdio.h>
  int main() {
    printf("Hello, I'm Jae!");
  }
  ```

* My research interests are statistical learning and its applications to biomedical data.
