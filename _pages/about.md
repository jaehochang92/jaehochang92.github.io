* I am a prospective Ph.D. student planning to study in the United States. I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Applied Statistics at <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Eng/Index.do" target="_blank">Konkuk University</a> under the supervision of professor <a href="http://home.konkuk.ac.kr/~kyusangu" target="_blank">Kyusang Yu</a>.

* My research interests are statistical learning and its applications to biomedical data.
  
* I am an instrumental progressive music enthusiast! I have played the electronic guitar for over 15 years, and I am a huge fan of Eric Johnson and John Petrucci.
